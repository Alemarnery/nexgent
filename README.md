## Survey

Create a new branch "survey".
Please open a pull request to the default branch with your answer to the following questions.

- [x] I have read the job description and understand the qualifications, the responsibilities and the compensation of this position.

1. What are you most proud of as a front-end developer?
   I am proud to make beautiful and responsive designs that enhance usability and looks natural to the eye of the final user. I love being a front-end developer because I am responsible of what the user sees first and how I make user experience as seamless as possible.
1. What do you enjoy most working as a front-end developer?
   Building components from scratch and improve them by adding complexity as the project grows. I also love writing docs or PropTypes for all the components I write (once they are intelligent enough haha).
1. What is your favorite software development principle(s) and/or design pattern(s)?
   DRY - I love Don't Repeat Yourself and try to encapsulate related logic. And for design patterns I usually do Mobile-First designs. I love how web projects look awesome (and even better) than mobile apps!
1. What is the top 1 (or up to 3) accomplishments you achieved in your previous company?

- Organized
- Focused
- Open Minded

1. How do you like TDD?
   It is not a practice that I implement on a daily basis, however I enjoy it a lot. I believe when a person works for a company which has its software foundations already settled, it makes sense to do TDD.
   Since I love creating and prototyping as fast as possible, I usually dive right into the business logic and implementation.
